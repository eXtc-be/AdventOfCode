# aoc_2023_06_B_1.py - Day 6: Wait For It - part 2
# How many ways can you beat the record in this one much longer race?
# https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6
# same formula as aoc_2023_06_A_2, only difference is the time and distance values are now concatenated
# and only 1 calculation is necessary
