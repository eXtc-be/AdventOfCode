# aoc_2023_08_B_1.py - Day 8: Haunted Wasteland - part 2
# Simultaneously start on every node that ends with A.
# How many steps does it take before you're only on nodes that end with Z?
# https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8
# aoc_2023_08_B_1 ran for over 12 hours and didn't produce a result
# after reading some threads on reddit, I am now going to try 'Least Common Multiplier' (LCM)
# first I need to figure out the loop size for each starting node,
# then calculate the LCM of the loop sizes + the instructions length to get the final result, hopefully
